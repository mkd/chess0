// perft
//
// Raw node count, up to depth, doing a full tree search.
// perft is very similar to the search algorithm - instead of evaluating the leaves, we count them.
//
// perft is a good way of verifying correctness of the movegenerator and (un)makeMove,
// because you can compare the results with published results for certain test positions.
//
// perft is also used to measure the performance of the move generator and (un)makeMove in terms
// of speed, and to compare different implementations of generating, storing and (un)making moves.
