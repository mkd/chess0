WORK IN PROGRESS
================



BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================



IMPORTANT
=========
- Fix cache: re-implement from scratch (try both hashkey and FEN string)
  - Test 1: no corrupted board (e.g., 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 and another queen
    appears, or move is Bh3). Probably has to do with rememberPV(). Should be
    able to either store the whole PV in TT to reconstruct or clear the PV after
    cache hit
  - Look at crafty search.c to understand where to insert cache routines within
    the search function

- Clean-up code:
  - Remove functions.h (include every necessary .h file)
  - Move all extglobals into app.h (like in chess0x)
  - Move all globals into corresponding .h files (like in chess0x)

- Razoring

- Ending tables (syzygy)

- Lazy SMP



WISH LIST
=========
- Read/write PGN files.

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
