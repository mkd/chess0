TODO
====
- test NNUE with LMR without LMR
- clean up old eval()
- Review entire search algorithm
- Review quiesce
- Review LMR
- Add killer heuristic
- Add aspiration window
- Review MVV/LVA
- Review move ordering (debug by printing list of ordered moves in BBC and Chess0)
- Re-write cach√©
- Win64 compilation
- Try copyBoard() instead of unmake. See performance impact
- Review iterative deepening (search_position ~= think)
- Check is it useful to implement mate_score and mate_value as separate values
- add book/learn to UCI



INFINITY WARS
=============
- Automate generation of opening positions from Stockfish multipv=5 (if score diff under 25cp)
- Add more intelligence to timeControl
- Clean-up code:
  - Same endgame draw code from eval.cpp to search.cpp isEndOfGame
  - Remove functions.h (include every necessary .h file)
  - Move all extglobals into app.h (like in chess0x)
  - Move all globals into corresponding .h files (like in chess0x)
- Ending tables (syzygy)
- Lazy SMP
- Read/write PGN files.
- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
