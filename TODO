WORK IN PROGRESS
================
- Fix cache: chooses bad moves and creates search instability.



BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================
- Clean-up code:
  - Remove functions.h (include every necessary .h file)
  - Move all extglobals into app.h (like in chess0x)
  - Move all globals into corresponding .h files (like in chess0x)



SOME DAY
========
- Proper razoring

- Ending tables (syzygy)

- Lazy SMP

- Read/write PGN files.

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
