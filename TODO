TODO
====


WORK IN PROGRESS
================
- Save/load board
  - boardToFEN() (implement FEN writer by looping on the board)
  - FENToBoard() (use readFEN and setup.cpp)



BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================
- Implement commands:
  - pass/null
  - material
  - info (eval, material, phase, sideToMove)



IMPORTANT
=========
- Improve evaluation function (opening, middle, end)

- Proper cache implementation ttEntry and Cache class, use Zobrist for index and
  LRU to make sure it doesn't explode into Gbytes of data. Condition: cache=true
  should make the program noticeably faster and stronger at every time.

- Razoring

- Ending tables (syzygy)



WISH LIST
=========
- Read/write PGN files.

- Lazy SMP

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
