TODO
====


WORK IN PROGRESS
================
- Fix mating move --> When found mating move, don't search any more (and don't
  crash)

- Move ordering: check how moves are sorted, because sometimes it prefers not to
  pin the queen, even at depth 6, but instead takes a pawn

- Fix cache: no PV moves stored, so start from scratch at high depth



BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================
- Edit board

- Save/load board



IMPORTANT
=========
- Replace BOOLTYPE with bool

- Improve evaluation function (opening, middle, end)

- Razoring

- Ending tables (syzygy)

- Fine-tune LMR



WISH LIST
=========
- Read/write PGN files.

- Lazy SMP

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
