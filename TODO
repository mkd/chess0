TODO
====
- Add better endgame draw heuristics:
-- The Weaker Side has a Minor Piece against two Knights
-- Two Bishops draw against a Bishop
-- Two Minor Pieces against one draw, except when the Stronger Side has a Bishop Pair

- Fix cache with PV

- Clean-up code:
  - Same endgame draw code from eval.cpp to search.cpp isEndOfGame
  - Remove functions.h (include every necessary .h file)
  - Move all extglobals into app.h (like in chess0x)
  - Move all globals into corresponding .h files (like in chess0x)


- UCI protocol


- Simple time management (e.g., <10min = 9s; <2min = 1s) 
  - remember to leverage timeControl() implementation in search.cpp



SOME DAY
========
- Ending tables (syzygy)
- Lazy SMP
- Read/write PGN files.
- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
