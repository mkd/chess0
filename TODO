TODO

WORK IN PROGRESS
================
- Fix cache: corrupted board (e.g., 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 and another queen appears, or move is Bh3), probably has to do with rememberPV(). Should be able to store the whole PV in TT to reconstruct. Like makeMove() and unmakeMove() are not even when using cache.
- Implement: cache.h should implement triangularArray, and if (cached), triangularArray should overwrite to the cache, so it can be restored at any time when (cahced) and cacheHit ;-)



BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================
- Code refactoring

- Implement many useful commands: info (midgame, etc), lmr 1/2/3, etc.

- Evaluation: king under heavy attack is too optimistic
  - chess0-crafty.c0 -> eval should be -5.33, it is -1.5 instead --> penalty for
    check without mobility: e.g., penalty = 100 * (8 - mobility)

- Make sure cache is fast enough --> old cache implementation (hashToStr) was
  3.5x slower than without cache (i.e., kN/s was 3.5 times less when cache ON,
  and up to 20x slower when cache goes over 1Gb)

- Remove functions.h (include every necessary .h file)

- Move all extglobals into app.h (like in chess0x)

- Move all globals into corresponding .h files (like in chess0x)



IMPORTANT
=========
- Razoring

- Ending tables (syzygy)

- Lazy SMP



WISH LIST
=========
- Read/write PGN files.

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
