TODO
====


WORK IN PROGRESS
================
- Implement cache (ttEntry = hashkey + depth)



BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
===================
- Edit board

- Save/load board



IMPORTANT
=========
- Fix weird moves (eval.cpp??), e.g., Rb1 or h3--Rh2 in the opening ??

- Replace BOOLTYPE with bool

- Improve evaluation function (opening, middle, end)

- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)

- Lazy SMP



WISH LIST
=========
- Read/write PGN files.

- Full BitBoard-based move generation and search.

- Multi-thread engine (i.e., top N moves, each goes to one thread)

- Think during opponent's time (dependency: transposition tables)
