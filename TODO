TODO
====
- Fix cache: chooses bad moves and creates search instability.
- Clean-up code:
  - Remove functions.h (include every necessary .h file)
  - Move all extglobals into app.h (like in chess0x)
  - Move all globals into corresponding .h files (like in chess0x)
- UCI protocol



SOME DAY
========
- Ending tables (syzygy)
- Lazy SMP
- Read/write PGN files.
- Ponder support (test that works once Cache is enabled)
