# Overview
Chess0 [pronounced ***chess-ou***] is a computer chess program developed in C++
and loosely based on [Winglet](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Winglet), by
Stef Luijten. Chess0 was developed as a final year project for my Computer
Science degree and, therefore, it is not the most competitive chess engine you
can find.

If you need a modern engine with proper chess skills, you should check out
[Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish).

Chess0's current approximate ELO rating is around ~2640, based on the Elometer
test (http://www.elometer.net), various tournaments against other rated chess
engines, and a series of games played on the
[Free Internet Chess Server (FICS)](https://www.freechess.org/).

# Building Chess0
The default [Makefile](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/src/Makefile)
in [src](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/src) contains the instructions
to build Chess0 in Unix systems, and it has been tested both on Linux and MacOS.

Cross-compilation to Windows 64-bit should be possible using e.g., mingw32;
however, I haven't taken the time to add that in the Makefile yet.



# Using Chess0
## Using the command line interface (CLI)
Chess0 was built with research and learn purposes in mind. That is, by design,
I didn't develop Chess0 to be a super-portable, highly competitive chess
engine. Instead, I focused on code clarity and ease of use in the command line
interface (CLI).

When you run Chess0, it prompts you with a ready-to-move interface like this:
```
Welcome to Chess0!

White (1):
```

This means that the engine automatically starts a new game, where White can
enter the first (1) move. You can enter here moves in short algebraic notation
(SAN) to start playing against the computer. SAN moves are the ones used in 
modern chess literature; e.g., Nf3 Bxd5+ 0-0 d8=Q. As you enter your move,
the computer will start thinking (and, by default, you can see how it's 
thinking) and return the best move after the thinking time is up. By default,
the thinking time for the computer is 5s. See the following example:
```
White (1): e4

White (2): 
```

Besides entering moves, this prompt also is used to enter different commands to
change the type of the game as well as configuring some settings. Just type
'help' to see the following list:
```
Welcome to Chess0!

White (1): help
analyze  auto  book  cache  depth  eval  fen  flip
game  go  help  history  lmr  load  manual  new  null
pass  quiet  quit  recall  remove  resign  restart
save  sd  set  setboard  show  silent  solve  st  test
think  uci  verbose  undo  version
```

For any of those settings, you can simply type 'help COMMAND' for every
setting and Chess0 will show you further instructions on how to use
a specific settings. For example:

```
White (1): help cache

cache [on | off]
 Let the computer use the transposition tables to find
 previously searched positions faster. This typically
 makes the engine more powerful in middle and end-game.
 Please note that using transposition tables can take
 a few hundreds of Megabytes for a ~1h game.
```

## Using a graphical user interface (GUI)
Thanks to the UCI protocol, you can use Chess0 with your favorite chess GUI. 
Chess GUI applications use the UCI protocol to communicate with the engine, so
you can analyze your games, play against it or even run a computer chess
tournament from your own computer.

I personally use [ScidvsMac](http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/) (a version
of ScidvsPC for MacOS) to test Chess0. There's a ton of free chess graphical
interfaces for UCI chess engines, just pick your favorite one.



# Implementation
Chess0 is implemented mainly in C++, with numerous functions written in pure C
for performance reasons. When I wrote the first version of Chess0, I tried to
use only C++ with strict object orientation. This made the code much more
readable and maintainable. However, C++ objects starated to become a real
bottleneck as the search tree grew. So finally, I decided to optimize core
objects and functionalities using C-like structures whenever the execution
speed would increase exponentially.

Starting from version 1.3, Chess0 relies on Stockfish' neural networks (NNUE)
to find the evaluation of a given position. In order to ensure a proper
behavior, you need to make sure the neural network file (i.e., 
nn-eba324f53044.nnue) is in the current directory of execution. This also
mean you must configure the path to Chess0 in your GUI, so that it can find
the neural network file. Otherwise, the engine will play random moves.



# Contributing to Chess0
This is not one of my most active projects at the moment. There're way too many
great things out there to stay inside coding another chess engine for ages
(it's a work that never ends!). So, if you have tried Chess0 and would like to
improve the current source code in any way, please go ahead!
