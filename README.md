# Chess0
Chess0 is a computer chess program developed in C++ and based on Winglet chess
by Stef Luijten. Chess0 is just an example of chess programming and it's
approximate ELO rating is around ~2200, based on the Elometer test (http://www.elometer.net).

Two main features are still missing or partially implemented:
- Proper cache (using transposition tables)
- Lazy SMP (for parallel search on multi-threaded environments)


## Download
Binaries are available for Chess0. By downloading the ZIP files below, you get
the binary version of the program, which can be run on 64-bit computers with Mac
OSX, GNU/Linux or Windows. The latest version is 1.0-alpha:
- [Chess0 v1.1-beta OS X 64-bit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/261zuw5bmot6lzl/chess0-osx-1.1-beta?dl=0)

- [Chess0 v0.6 GNU/Linux 64-bit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/229ibt50f4dhklr/chess0-linux-0.6?dl=0)
- [Chess0 v0.6 Windows 64-bit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aqs86mr71hn6krd/chess0-win64-0.6.exe?dl=0)


## Implementation
Chess0 is fully implemented in C++. I used object orientation in the first
versions to make the code more readable, however C++ objects become a real
bottleneck as the search tree starts to grow (i.e., moves being implemented as
C++ objects create a huge bottleneck in performance). Therefore, the recent
versions of Chess0, although implemented in C++, use C-like structures and
functions whenever the execution can run faster that way.

Chess0's implementation is currently based on
[Winglet](http://aghaznawi.comuf.com/computer%20chess/winglet/) chess by Stef Luijten.

- **Winboard/XBoard support:** Chess0 supports the XBoard protocol version 2, which means
  that you can play against Chess0 using a graphical user interface (GUI) board.

- **Simple Machine Learning:** Chess0 can learn from won games on moves that
  actually work, and play them again if similar situations are found.

- **Opening book:** Chess0 comes with a built-in openings book (currently about
  2700 learned theory lines). The book is always in use by default, however you
  can disable it with the command 'book off'.
