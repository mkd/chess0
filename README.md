# Overview
Chess0 is a computer chess program developed in C++ and based on Winglet chess
by Stef Luijten. Chess0 is just an example of chess programming and it's
approximate ELO rating is around ~2200, based on the Elometer test (http://www.elometer.net).

Two main features are still missing or partially implemented:
- Proper cache (using transposition tables)
- Lazy SMP (for parallel search on multi-threaded environments)


# Files
This distribution of Chess0 consists of the following files:
- [README.md](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/README.md), the file you are currently reading.
- [copying.txt](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/copying.txt), a text file containing the GNU General Public License version 3.
- [TODO](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/TODO), a list of improvements and future features (i.e., a backlog).
- [Changelog](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/Changelog), a readable list of changes introduced in every version.
- [book_count.sh](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/book_count.sh), a script to count the number of opening entries in the book.
- [lines.sh](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/lines.sh), a script to count the number of lines in the source code.
- [src](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/src), a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a Makefile that can be used to compile Chess0 on Unix-like systems.



# Building Chess0 for your own computer
The default [Makefile](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/src/Makefile) in [src](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/src)
contains heavy optimizations for Intel-based 64-bit CPUs.

In order to build Chess0 for your own specific CPU, just change the **-march=** setting to your specific CPU type.



# Implementation
Chess0 is fully implemented in C++. I used object orientation in the first
versions to make the code more readable, however C++ objects become a real
bottleneck as the search tree starts to grow (i.e., moves being implemented as
C++ objects create a huge bottleneck in performance). Therefore, the recent
versions of Chess0, although implemented in C++, use C-like structures and
functions whenever the execution can run faster that way.

Chess0's implementation is currently based on
[Winglet](http://aghaznawi.comuf.com/computer%20chess/winglet/) chess by Stef Luijten.

- **Simple Machine Learning:** Chess0 can learn from won games on moves that
  actually work, and play them again if similar situations are found.

  positions). The book is always in use by default, however you can disable
  it with the command 'book off'.
