# Overview
Chess0 is a computer chess program developed in C++ and based on [Winglet](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Winglet), by Stef Luijten.
Chess0 was developed as a final year project for my Computer
Science degree and, therefore, it is not a very competitive chess entity.

If you need a modern engine with proper chess skills, try out [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish).

Chess0's current approximate ELO rating is around ~2200, based on the Elometer test (http://www.elometer.net),
and a series of games played on the [Free Internet Chess Server (FICS)](https://www.freechess.org/).

Chess0 is an incomplete chess program. Here're the main features missing from it at the moment:
- Stable cache implementation using transposition tables (the current implementation is buggy)
- UCI protocol, in order to connect it to a GUI
- Simple time management for games
- Lazy SMP (for parallel search on multi-threaded environments)



# Files
This distribution of Chess0 consists of the following files:
- [README.md](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/README.md), the file you are currently reading.
- [copying.txt](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/copying.txt), a text file containing the GNU General Public License version 3.
- [TODO](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/TODO), a list of improvements and future features (i.e., a backlog).
- [Changelog](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/Changelog), a readable list of changes introduced in every version.
- [book_count.sh](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/book_count.sh), a script to count the number of opening entries in the book.
- [lines.sh](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/lines.sh), a script to count the number of lines in the source code.
- [src](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/src), a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a Makefile that can be used to compile Chess0 on Unix-like systems.



# Building Chess0
The default [Makefile](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/src/Makefile) in [src](https://github.com/mkd/chess0/blob/master/src)
contains heavy optimizations for Intel-based 64-bit CPUs.

In order to build Chess0 for your own specific CPU, just change the **-march=** setting to your specific CPU type.



# Implementation
Chess0 is fully implemented in C++. I used object orientation in the first
versions to make the code more readable, however C++ objects become a real
bottleneck as the search tree starts to grow (i.e., moves being implemented as
C++ objects create a huge bottleneck in performance). Therefore, the recent
versions of Chess0, although implemented in C++, use C-like structures and
functions whenever the execution can run faster that way.

Some of the controls in Chess0 still use old-fashioned implementations. For
example C++ has clock_t for accurating time tracking, yet Chess0 still has
the old code in it. If you feel like improving the current source code, please
go ahead!
